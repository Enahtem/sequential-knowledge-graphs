On a sunny afternoon in a small town, a little girl named Mia wandered into the park.
She loved to explore the lush green grass and colorful flowers.
As she skipped along the path, she heard a soft whimpering sound.
Curious, Mia followed the sound until she found a tiny, brown puppy curled up under a bench.
Its big, sad eyes looked up at her, and her heart melted.
"Oh, you poor thing! Are you lost?" she asked.
Mia gently approached the puppy, who wagged its tail hesitantly.
She reached out her hand, and the puppy sniffed it before nuzzling against her.
Mia decided to name him Max.
She looked around the park but couldn’t see anyone searching for him.
"Don’t worry, Max. I’ll help you find your home!" she said confidently.
They spent the afternoon walking around, asking other park visitors if they recognized the puppy.
After what felt like hours, a woman appeared, calling out, "Max! Max!"
The puppy perked up, barking excitedly and running towards her.
It was his owner, Sarah, who had been searching for him frantically.
Mia watched as Sarah knelt down, tears of joy in her eyes, hugging Max tightly.
"Thank you so much for finding him!" Sarah said, grateful for Mia's kindness.
Mia smiled, happy to help.
As she waved goodbye to Max and Sarah, she felt a warm glow in her heart.
That day, she learned that sometimes, a small act of kindness could make a big difference.
